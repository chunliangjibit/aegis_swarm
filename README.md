# Aegis Swarm - Tactical AI Laboratory

## Overview

Aegis Swarm is a simulation platform for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm tactics and multi-agent AI research. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to configure, run, and visualize confrontation scenarios between opposing forces (Red vs. Blue).

This project is designed as a laboratory for developing and testing autonomous swarm strategies.

## Features

-   **Graphical User Interface**: An interactive GUI built with PyQt5 for managing and visualizing simulations.
-   **Red vs. Blue Scenarios**: Simulates tactical confrontations between two opposing teams.
-   **Configurable Strategies**: Easily define and modify agent behaviors and strategies using YAML configuration files.
-   **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Models the complex interactions within a swarm of autonomous agents.
